### Sicherman Dice

Sicherman dice are an alternate labeling of the sides a pair of classic cubical dice such that the number of ways to produce the **sums** of a pair of regular dice is the same.

Ordinary 6-sided dice have possible sums of **2** through **11**, and the number of ways of getting each sum is

| Sum       |  2  | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
| --------- | :-: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| # of ways |  1  | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |

In 1978, Sicherman came up with the alternate labeling of

**die #1 : 1,  2,  2,  3,  3,  4**
**die #2 :  1,  3,  4,  5,  6,  8**

For these dice, the possible sums are also from 2 to 12.  Furthermore, if you tally up the number of ways to get each sum, you find that *you get the exact same table as above*.

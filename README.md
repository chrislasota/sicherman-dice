Sicherman dice are an alternate labeling of the sides a pair of ordinary cubical dice such that the number of ways to produce the **sums** of a pair of regular dice is the same.

Ordinary 6-sided dice have possible sums of 2 through 11, and the number of ways of getting each sum is

|  2  | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  1  | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |

Sicherman's dice have an alternate labeling:
$\qquad\qquad\qquad$ 
$\qquad\qquad\qquad$<strong style="color: #a00">die #1 : 1,  2,  2,  3,  3,  4</strong>$\qquad\qquad\qquad$ <strong style="color: #00a">die #2 :  1,  3,  4,  5,  6,  8</strong>

Notice that for these dice, the possible sums are also from 2 to 12.  Furthermore, if you tally up the number of ways to get each sum, you find that you get the exact same table as above.
